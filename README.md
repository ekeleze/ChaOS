# ChaOS
### A GUI OS made with [MOSA](https://github.com/mosa/MOSA-Project)

## What is the difference between ChaOS-Classic, ChaOS 2.0 Prototype, and ChaOS 2.0?

ChaOS-Classic was the very fist ChaOS made with Cosmos, in 2022.
Over time the codebase got so bad it was abandoned.

ChaOS 2.0 Prototype was a failed attempt at making the new ChaOS 2.0 in Cosmos a while back.

And ChaOS 2.0 is the current iteration of ChaOS, made in MOSA, and focused on being easy to use, somewhat fast, and flexable.
